	<h1>Design Challenge 1</h1>
	
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		
	<p>FiftyThree - <a href="http://www.fiftythree.com/paper" target = "_blank">www.fiftythree.com/paper</a></p>
	<p>Promethean IT - <a href="promethenit.com" target = "_blank">www.prometheanit.com</a></p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>

	<p><strong>FiftyThree</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Page is broken up into 6 frames as you scroll, each being the same size but with different grid column formats</li>
		<li>Focal points are the headlines of each frame, well scaled with the background</li>
		<li>First two frames have very little negative space, clustered animated graphics are balanced with large, centered text</li>
		<li>More negative space is mixed in as you scroll down to lower frames, focusing attention on text and animations</li>
		<li>Site encourages scrolling through each frame</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>PrometheanIT</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Simple minimalist webpage, lots of open space, no images or graphics apart from 6 colored columns</li>
		<li>Huge focal point is the centered company name/logo, effective use of space and color contrast to make it an interesting home page</li>
		<li>Single frame homepage, minimal hierarchy, encourages clicking through each tab, which includes more nested click-throughs</li>
		<li>Becomes a little boring, could use more focal points on each sub-page or more graphical content</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

	<p>Each page is very different from each other.  Promethean is very simple, with lots of negative space and just a single frame to navigate through for almost the entire site.  Promethean also has a consistent color pattern.  FiftyThree, on the other hand, is relatively cluttered with graphics and animations, is highly animated and multi-frame.  Both have interesting navigation features, but Promethean encourages clicking while FiftyThree encourages scrolling.</p>

	<h2>Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

	<p>The following sketches are for a potential book-centric personal blog.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Home Page Sketch 1</strong>
			<br><img src="images/image.jpeg"></li>
			<p>In this first sketch, I'm going for a large, centered picture and title as the focal point, surrounded by a lot of negative space.  As you scroll down, I put a thin bar with links to additional pages that helps to frame the top picture/title.  Below the bar, the hierarchy flow shifts to 2 columns of different sized, evenly spaced rectangles that will contain a picture.  The arrangement of these pictures/posts are aimed to encourage exploration.  At the bottom of each rectangle will be a transparent box with the title of the post.</p>  
		<li><strong>Home Page Sketch 2</strong>
			<br><img src="images/image2.jpeg"></li>
			<p>In this second sketch, I'm going for a single frame webpage that has a very large image and title on the left side of the screen and scrollable, uneven rectangles on the right side.  These rectangles are similar to the ones in sketch 1 but will be smaller and the title will only show up if you scroll-over the images.  I have also placed the links bar at the top of the screen.  The focal point is heavily on the left side of the screen to the large image/title, but since the screen is symettrically cut in two, the right side of the screen will be the natural point of attention after the title.</p> 
	</ul>
